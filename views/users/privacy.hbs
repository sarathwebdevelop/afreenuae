            <p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how the personally identifiable information (“Personal
                Information”) you may provide on the metallica.ae website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its
                related products and services (collectively, “Services”) is collected, protected and used. It also
                describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can
                access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”,
                “you” or “your”) and this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). By accessing and using the
                Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms
                of this Agreement. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or
                control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>


            <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
            <p>When you open the Website, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This
                data may include information such as your device’s IP address, browser type and version, operating
                system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the
                Website and Services, pages of the Website and Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages,
                information you search for on the Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
            <p>Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish
                statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This statistical
                information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the
                system.</p>

            <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
            <p>You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any
                information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you
                wish to use some of the features on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal
                Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you
                knowingly provide to us when you create an account, or fill any online forms on the Website. When
                required, this information may include the following:</p>
            <p>Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.</p>
            <p>Contact information such as email address, address, etc.</p>
            <p>Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.</p>
            <p>Geolocation data such as latitude and longitude.</p>
            <p>Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website and Services. However, we may
                also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases and our joint
                marketing partners. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may
                not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what
                information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>

            <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
            <p>In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to
                collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we
                may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we
                collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>

            <h2>Create and manage user accounts</h2>
            <p>Request user feedback.</p>
            <p>Improve user experience.</p>
            <p>Fullfil and manage orders.</p>
            <p>Deliver Products or Services.</p>
            <p>Deliver targeted advertising.</p>
            <p>Send marketing and promotional communications.</p>
            <p>Improve Products and Services.</p>
            <p>Request to inquiries and offer support.</p>
            <p>Enforce terms conditions and policies.</p>
            <p>Protect from abuse and malicious users.</p>
            <p>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</p>
            <p>Run and operate the Website and Services.</p>
            <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you
                are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or
                more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information
                is subject to European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the
                performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii)
                processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing
                is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or
                by a third party.</p>
            <p>Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases
                below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,
                and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual
                requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

            <h2>Managing information</h2>
            <p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can
                delete may change as the Website and Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we
                may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to
                comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you
                would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so on the
                settings page of your account on the Website.</p>

            <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
            <p>Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service
                you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that
                work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the
                Website and Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third
                parties. These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as
                necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share your
                Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent
                with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third
                parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions,
                and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other
                purposes.</p>
            <p>We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law,
                such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that
                disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
                fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>

            <h2>Retention of information</h2>
            <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
                obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required
                or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal
                Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once
                the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the
                right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
                the expiration of the retention period.</p>

            <h2>The rights of users</h2>
            <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the
                right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given
                your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing
                of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have
                the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects
                of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to
                verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the
                right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we
                will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under
                certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the
                right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if
                technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision
                is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is
                based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>The Website and Services use “cookies” to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text
                file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
                deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web
                server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
            <p>We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate the
                Website and Services. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
                accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. To
                learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit internetcookies.org</p>

            <h2>Email marketing</h2>
            <p>We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We are committed to
                keeping your e-mail address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any third parties
                except as allowed in the information use and processing section. We will maintain the information sent
                via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
            <p>You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe
                instructions included in these emails or by contacting us. However, you will continue to receive
                essential transactional emails.</p>

            <h2>Information security</h2>
            <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
                unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
                safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of
                Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or
                wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
                acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our
                control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between
                you and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be
                viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>

            <h2>Data breach</h2>
            <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or users
                Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
                including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably
                appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as
                notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will
                make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of
                harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we
                will send you an email, mail you a letter.</p>

            <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the Website and Services from time to
                time in our discretion and will notify you of any material changes to the way in which we treat Personal
                Information. When we do, we will put it out in our website. Any updated version of this Policy will be
                effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued
                use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act
                specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without
                your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the
                time your Personal Information was collected.</p>

            <h2>Acceptance of this policy</h2>
            <p>You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing
                and using the Website and Services you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by
                the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Website and Services.</p>

            <h2>Contacting us</h2>
            <p>If you would like to contact us to understand more about this Policy or wish to contact us concerning any
